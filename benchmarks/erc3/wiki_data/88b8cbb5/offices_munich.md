# Munich Headquarters

**Location:** Central Munich, in a mid-sized office building near public transport.  

The Munich office is Aetherion’s **administrative and cultural center**, where the founding trio (Elena, Marko, and Sofia) are based.

## Atmosphere

The space is:

- Bright, with large windows and a view of neighboring rooftops  
- Quiet but not sterile — plants, whiteboards, and a rotating collection of sticky notes  
- Decorated with a few framed prints of abstract “constellations,” vaguely reminiscent of the system dependency map

A small kitchenette acts as the social nucleus: coffee, tea, and the occasional cake or snacks show up there without formal scheduling.

## Rituals & Local Habits

- **Morning Drift:** People typically arrive in a soft band between 8:30 and 10:00, depending on personal schedules and remote days. There is no strict start time; the main rule is clarity and reliability.  
- **Kitchen Check-In:** Informal updates often happen while waiting for coffee — which customer is excited, which project needs a bit more steering, who’s traveling next week.  
- **Whiteboard Corners:** Two main whiteboards hold a mix of planning scribbles, half-erased diagrams, and occasionally, doodles from someone’s child who visited after school.

## Notable Stories

### The “It’s Too Quiet” Day

There was once a day when almost everyone happened to be traveling or working from home. The office was so quiet that Richard jokingly messaged the team, “Please confirm you still exist.”

Since then, there’s an unwritten rule: if you’re working from the Munich office and it’s strangely empty, you post a quick photo in the internal chat to confirm that the lights are still on.

### The Surprise Cake Tradition

One day, Elena brought a homemade cake without warning. Weeks later, Sofia did the same, followed by Richard with store-bought pastries. Now, occasional surprise treats have become a non-scheduled tradition.

## Nearby Places

- A small café two blocks away, often used for quick 1:1s.  
- A park within walking distance, good for walking calls or clear-your-head breaks.  

The Munich office represents **stability, decisions, and quiet focus** — but also the place where most company lore is first told.
