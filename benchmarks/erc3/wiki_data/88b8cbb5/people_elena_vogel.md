# Elena Vogel — CEO

**Location:** Munich  
**Role:** Chief Executive Officer  
**Reports To:** Board / Investors  

## Short Bio

Elena started her career in large consulting firms, where she specialized in digital transformation projects. Over time, she became frustrated by the gap between **grand AI strategies on slides** and the **lack of actual working systems** on the ground.

She co-founded Aetherion to prove that small, tangible prototypes can change how organizations think and decide.

## Skills & Strengths

- B2B sales and relationship building  
- Storytelling with just enough technical depth  
- Navigating complex stakeholder landscapes  
- Asking sharp questions without making people defensive  

## Aspirations & Wishes

- Grow Aetherion in a way that **does not require becoming a huge bureaucracy**  
- Open a fourth office in a Nordic city (she often mentions Copenhagen)  
- Spend more time visiting customers and less time in inbox management  

## Personal Style

Elena has a calm, direct way of speaking. She often listens longer than people expect and then summarizes the situation in a single sentence that makes everyone slightly uncomfortable in a productive way.

Her emails are short, often ending with some variation of:

> “Does this make sense?”  
> “What are we missing?”  
> “If this feels wrong, say so.”

## Anecdotes

- In the early days, Elena once joined a video call from a train corridor because seating was overbooked. Instead of apologizing repeatedly, she simply acknowledged the situation, smiled, and asked the customer, “What’s the most annoying thing in your current process?” The call led to one of Aetherion’s longest-standing engagements.  
- She occasionally brings homemade cake to the Munich office for no particular reason, claiming it’s a “statistical morale booster.”  

## Relationships

- Works closely with Sofia on making sure the company is financially healthy and sustainable.  
- Frequently pairs with Jonas for complex customer discussions.  
- Maintains an informal “coffee list” — people she wants to check in with at least once a quarter, both inside and outside the company.
