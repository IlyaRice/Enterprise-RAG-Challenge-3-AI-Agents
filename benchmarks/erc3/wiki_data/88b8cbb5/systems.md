# Systems Overview

Aetherion uses a small but carefully chosen set of internal systems. These systems support the company’s work without defining its identity.

> This page describes **what systems exist and what they are for**, not step-by-step usage.

## CRM

The CRM is a simple web-based system used to keep track of:

- Companies and contacts  
- Interaction history (meetings, calls, workshops)  
- High-level deal phases (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived)  

Most employees treat the CRM as a **shared memory** of customer context rather than a sales pipeline scoreboard.

### Cultural Notes

- Helene is known for writing particularly thorough notes that others secretly copy as templates.  
- Jonas often uses short, human summaries like “Customer is curious but cautious” or “They’re excited but blocked by internal politics.”

## Time & Expense Tracker

The time & expense tracker exists so the company can:

- Understand where effort is going  
- Reconcile invoicing with actual work  
- Spot patterns that might indicate overload on certain people or projects  

It tracks:

- Hours by person and by customer project  
- Basic expense categories (travel, hardware, cloud, miscellaneous)

### Cultural Notes

- The tool occasionally sends reminder emails that the team jokingly refers to as “gentle haunting.”  
- Richard is the unofficial “time whisperer,” helping people remember what they did on days that blur together.

## System Dependency Tracker

This is one of Aetherion’s most beloved internal tools.

It maps:

- **Customer systems** (e.g., “Line 3 anomaly detection”, “Document assistant for legal”)  
- **Components** (models, services, dashboards, hardware devices)  
- **Responsible employees** for each component  

It also includes a simple notion of risk:

- If a critical system has only one person who understands it deeply  
- If that person is already involved in multiple other critical systems  
- If no backup person is documented

### Cultural Notes

- The dependency map is sometimes shown during internal discussions as a kind of “galaxy of responsibility.”  
- When a new system is onboarded, someone inevitably jokes, “Who is the brave soul who will appear as a node here?”  
- A running joke refers to high-risk chains as “spaghetti constellations.”

## Internal Knowledge Spaces

Beyond formal systems, Aetherion uses:

- A lightweight wiki (this one) for long-lived knowledge.  
- Chat channels for quick exchange and banter.  
- Occasional long-form documents for more reflective thinking.

The philosophy is simple: **knowledge should be searchable, linkable, and not locked in anyone’s head**.

## Nuances

Because the company is international, we need to account for the keyboard layouts in different countries. So all international variations of spelling have to be considered when searching. E.g. German `ö` is `oe`
