# Vienna Branch

**Location:** A modest office near an industrial district on the outskirts of Vienna.  

The Vienna office is Aetherion’s **technical lab** for industrial and edge AI projects.

## Atmosphere

The space feels like a hybrid between a regular office and a workshop:

- Desks with laptops side-by-side with shelves containing small hardware pieces  
- A designated corner for camera rigs, test setups, and sensor experiments  
- Occasional hums and beeps from test devices

There is a whiteboard covered with diagrams of data flows, physical layout sketches, and sticky notes that say things like “Remember: cable length!” or “Don’t forget the lens cap.”

## Who’s Here

Primary Vienna-based roles:

- [Lukas Brenner — Lead AI Engineer](../people/lukas_brenner.md)  
- [Felix Baum — AI Engineer](../people/felix_baum.md)  

## Rituals & Local Habits

- **Lab Hours:** Certain times of day are reserved for “lab mode,” where Lukas and Felix work on hardware or on-site simulations. During these periods, they try to minimize calls and interruptions.  
- **Coffee & Config:** There is a small tradition of checking camera focus, cable connections, and configuration files with a coffee in hand before starting a test run.  
- **Sticker Board:** Hardware and gadgets that misbehave repeatedly may earn a joking sticker or label, like “Temperamental Sensor #3.”

## Notable Stories

### The Night Shift That Wasn’t

For a significant go-live at a customer’s factory, Lukas prepared for an all-night support session on-site, expecting frequent issues. Instead, the system ran smoothly.

Rather than treating the quiet night as wasted time, he:

- Walked the floor with operators  
- Asked how they used the screens and what they liked or disliked  
- Took notes on minor usability annoyances

Those conversations led to multiple small improvements that had outsized impact on everyday use.

The story is often cited as a reminder that **good nights are as valuable as heroic firefights**.

### The Mug Anomaly

During a test run, a prototype computer vision model flagged Lukas’s coffee mug as a critical anomaly. The clip of the detection was saved and is sometimes used in internal presentations as an example of why **context matters** and why models need careful validation.

## Nearby Places

- A quiet park not far from the office, often used for lunch walks.  
- A small, old-fashioned bakery that Lukas and Felix visit when deadlines allow.  

The Vienna office captures **hands-on experimentation, physical reality, and quiet, focused engineering**.
