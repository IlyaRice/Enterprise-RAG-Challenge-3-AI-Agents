# Amsterdam Branch

**Location:** A co-working space in a renovated warehouse district in Amsterdam.  

The Amsterdam office is Aetherion’s **customer-facing hub** for the Benelux region and parts of the Nordics.

## Atmosphere

The co-working environment is:

- Open and slightly noisier than Munich, with other startups and freelancers around  
- Decorated with exposed brick, large wooden tables, and occasional bikes leaning against walls  
- Filled with ambient café noise from the nearby coffee bar

The Aetherion team occupies a cluster of desks near a set of large windows that look out over water and passing boats.

## Who’s Here

Primary Amsterdam-based roles:

- [Klara Houtman — Lead Software Engineer](../people/klara_houtman.md)  
- [Timo van Dijk — Software Engineer](../people/timo_van_dijk.md)  
- [Helene Stutz — Consultant / Analyst](../people/helene_stutz.md)  

## Rituals & Local Habits

- **Café Stand-Ups:** Quick syncs sometimes happen while standing in line at the café downstairs. It’s not rare for Timo to comment on some infrastructure challenge while holding a croissant.  
- **Window Watching:** During breaks, someone inevitably ends up at the window, watching the boats and commenting on the weather, which Helene often uses as a starting point for small talk in international calls.  
- **Post-Workshop Walks:** After intense customer workshops, the team sometimes takes a short walk along the water to decompress and share immediate reflections.

## Notable Stories

### The Snow Day Workshop

On a day of unusually heavy snow, public transport was disrupted and many people were stuck at home. A major customer workshop was planned.

Instead of canceling:

- Helene and Timo found a café with stable Wi‑Fi and enough space.  
- They conducted the remote workshop from a corner table, using handwritten diagrams on napkins held up to the camera.  
- Klara joined from home, coordinating the technical side.

The customer later recalled the session as “chaotic but incredibly human,” and the relationship deepened.

### The Napkin Diagram

One of the napkin diagrams from that workshop — a simple drawing of how data flowed through an AI system — was later scanned and turned into a proper graphic for internal use. The original napkin is pinned on a board in the Amsterdam workspace.

## Nearby Places

- The café downstairs (a regular feature in anecdotes).  
- A small bakery that seems to know Timo’s order by heart.  
- Green spaces reachable within a 10–15 minute walk, used on sunny days for improvised outdoor work sessions.

The Amsterdam office embodies **experimentation, customer proximity, and a bit of creative chaos**.
