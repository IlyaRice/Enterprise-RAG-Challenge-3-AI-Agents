# Ana Kovác — Senior AI Engineer

**Location:** Munich  
**Role:** Senior AI Engineer (NLP / LLMs)  
**Reports To:** Lead AI Engineer  

## Short Bio

Ana’s journey began in computational linguistics and quickly moved into natural language processing and large language models. She is the person people turn to when a project involves text, conversation, or complex documents.

She joined Aetherion to work on **practical, grounded LLM applications** rather than purely experimental research.

## Skills & Strengths

- NLP and large language models  
- Prompt design, evaluation, and guardrails  
- Designing experiments to compare model behavior  
- Explaining AI language behavior to non-technical stakeholders

## Aspirations & Wishes

- Run an ongoing internal “LLM lab” to test new models and techniques  
- Develop a robust evaluation framework for LLM-based PoCs  
- Explore more multilingual use cases

## Personal Style

Ana is curious, thoughtful, and slightly mischievous when it comes to testing the limits of models. She often uses humor to reveal how brittle or surprising AI-generated text can be.

She is known to say:

> “If the model sounds too confident, double-check everything.”

## Anecdotes

- In testing, she once prompted a model to “explain itself as if it were a small, apologetic dragon.” The resulting text became an internal meme and was briefly used as placeholder copy in an internal tool.  
- During a customer meeting, she drew a diagram of how LLM responses are shaped by prompts, training data, and randomness. The customer later said it was the first time they “actually understood how these things work.”

## Relationships

- Works closely with Marko on LLM architecture choices and infrastructure.  
- Collaborates with Jonas and Helene on how to frame AI language tools to end-users.  
- Partners with Klara and Mira to embed language models into usable interfaces.
