# Culture & Lore

Culture at Aetherion is not a slide deck — it’s a collection of small habits, running jokes, and stories people tell newcomers.

## How People Interact

- The default tone is **informal but respectful**. First names are used across levels, including the C‑suite.  
- Jargon is tolerated only when accompanied by clear explanations.  
- The team prefers **short written updates** over long, meandering calls.

There is a quiet pride in being “**the grown-ups in the AI room**” — technically sharp but emotionally steady.

## Rituals & Traditions

### 1. Demo Fridays (Story-Focused)

Most Fridays, someone shows a small demo or experiment to the rest of the team.  
The unwritten rule: **you’re allowed to show ugly, half-broken things**.

Memorable Demo Friday moments include:

- Lukas streaming from the Vienna lab with a prototype vision system that accidentally detected his coffee mug as a “critical anomaly.”  
- Ana presenting early prompts for a document assistant that insisted on signing emails as “Your humble language model overlord.”  
- Mira demoing a new UI theme where the buttons were so large that Marko joked they were “designed for use from across the street.”

Demo Fridays are less about polish and more about **shared curiosity and humor**.

### 2. The “Aether-Days”

A few times a year, the company runs an internal “Aether-Day” — a day kept deliberately light on external commitments so people can explore ideas, discuss learning, or just tidy up forgotten corners of the tech stack.

Some teams use it to:

- Try out a new open-source tool  
- Refactor a piece of internal glue code  
- Write long-overdue documentation with music on and cameras off  

Elena often describes Aether-Days as “**maintenance for our curiosity**.”

### 3. The Wall of Quotes (Digital)

In the internal chat, there is a channel dedicated to out-of-context team quotes. A few favorites:

- “This dashboard is technically correct, which is the worst kind of correct.” — Klara  
- “The model is not hallucinating, it’s just confidently wrong.” — Ana  
- “If we can’t explain this to my aunt in one paragraph, we don’t understand it yet.” — Elena  

New employees are warned that anything they say might one day end up on the Wall of Quotes.

### 4. EoY bonus tradition

It is a long-time tradition to give out a small token salary bonus (5-15 EUR) to the employee of the year at the end of the year. It started with the first employees and is still cherished.

## How Decisions Feel

Decisions at Aetherion are influenced by a few informal principles:

- **If it affects customers**, it gets explained clearly.  
- **If it affects workload**, Sofia and Richard will ask very detailed questions.  
- **If it affects technical foundations**, Marko will think three projects ahead.  

There is no hero culture. When someone pulls a late night, the question afterwards is not “How can we praise them?” but “**How can we avoid needing this next time?**”

## Communication Style

Regardless of location:

- People write in **short paragraphs**, often with bullet points.  
- Emojis are used sparingly but sincerely.  
- Sarcasm is reserved for technology, never for people.

When communicating with customers, employees are encouraged to be:

- **Direct** about risks  
- **Transparent** about what AI can and can’t do  
- **Grounded** in how solutions will affect actual users

## Internal Myths & Stories

A few stories circulate internally like myths:

### The Cat on the Keyboard

In the early days, during a critical remote demo, Marko’s cat walked across his keyboard, temporarily killing the terminal session running the demo. Instead of pretending nothing happened, he explained it openly, rebooted calmly, and resumed.

The customer later said, “We trust you more because you didn’t try to hide it.”

This story is now shorthand for **staying calm when things break**.

### The Amsterdam Snow Day

During an unusually heavy snowfall, the Amsterdam team was supposed to host an in-office customer workshop. Public transport failed, and the office was half-empty. Instead of canceling, Helene and Timo ran the workshop from a café with stable Wi‑Fi, using handwritten diagrams on napkins held up to the camera.

The customer still mentions “that snowy workshop” as the moment they decided to deepen the collaboration.

### The Vienna Night Shift That Wasn’t

Lukas once prepared for an all-night on-site support session at a factory in Austria, expecting constant issues after an AI system went live. The system ran smoothly; nothing broke.

He spent the night walking the factory floor, chatting with operators about how they actually used the system. The result was a set of small usability improvements that made a big difference.

Internally, this story reminds people that **quiet success is still worth talking about**.

## What the Company Protects

There are a few things Aetherion quietly but firmly protects:

- **People’s time for focused work**  
- **Weekends**, except in rare, clearly justified cases  
- **The ability to say “no”** to projects that look unhealthy or misaligned  

All of these are part of the culture, even if they’re not written into formal policy yet.
