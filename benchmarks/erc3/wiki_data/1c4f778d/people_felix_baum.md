# Felix Baum — AI Engineer

**Location:** Vienna  
**Role:** AI Engineer (Computer Vision & Optimization)  
**Reports To:** Lead AI Engineer  

## Short Bio

Felix studied computer science with a focus on machine learning and computer vision. He enjoys making models run **efficiently in constrained environments**, whether that’s on edge devices or in cost-sensitive cloud setups.

He joined Aetherion to work hands-on with physical systems and real-world image data.

## Skills & Strengths

- Computer vision model training and tuning  
- Model optimization (quantization, pruning, efficient architectures)  
- Data labeling workflows and tooling  
- Debugging weird edge cases in production-like setups

## Aspirations & Wishes

- Spend a few months working remotely from Spain while staying embedded in Vienna projects  
- Automate and improve the company’s risk scoring in the system dependency tracker  
- Experiment with synthetic data generation for computer vision PoCs

## Personal Style

Felix is easygoing and inventive. He tends to approach problems from multiple angles and is not afraid to try unconventional experiments before narrowing in on a solution.

He regularly says:

> “Let’s see what happens if we just try it.”

## Anecdotes

- Once, while investigating misclassifications, Felix discovered that glare from a stainless-steel surface was confusing the model. He rigged a surprisingly low-tech lighting diffuser that dramatically improved accuracy.  
- He created a small internal tool to visualize model predictions over time, complete with animated playback. The “play” button became an instant favorite for Demo Fridays.

## Relationships

- Works side-by-side with Lukas in Vienna on AI-heavy projects.  
- Syncs with Marko for more complex optimization or deployment questions.  
- Collaborates with Mira and Timo when computer vision models are integrated into broader systems.
