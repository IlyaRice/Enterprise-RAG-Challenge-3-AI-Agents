# Klara Houtman — Lead Software Engineer

**Location:** Amsterdam  
**Role:** Lead Software Engineer  
**Reports To:** CTO  

## Short Bio

Klara came from a background in web and backend engineering, having built systems for startups and established companies alike. She enjoys making things that **feel simple on the surface but are well-structured underneath**.

At Aetherion, she leads the software side of PoCs and internal tools, making sure systems are not just quick hacks but **extendable prototypes**.

## Skills & Strengths

- Backend architecture and API design  
- Frontend development with a focus on clarity and performance  
- DevOps and deployment pipelines for small teams  
- Balancing “build it right” with “build it fast enough”

## Aspirations & Wishes

- Improve Aetherion’s internal dev tooling so new projects start smoothly  
- Redesign the internal CRM UI to be more pleasant and less cluttered  
- Experiment with more visual interfaces for monitoring AI systems

## Personal Style

Klara is energetic and often brings a sense of playful experimentation to her work. She is known for sketching UI ideas on paper before touching a keyboard.

She has a favorite saying:

> “If the interface is confusing, the system is lying to somebody.”

## Anecdotes

- For an internal tool, she once added small, context-aware hints that only appear when users hover in certain corners. This delighted the team so much that someone made a bingo card of “Klara’s invisible UI treats.”  
- She attempted a bold new design for a dashboard in a demo, only to have Marko deadpan: “I love the buttons; I can see them from another continent.” The design was later refined, and the joke became part of the story.

## Relationships

- Works closely with Mira and Timo on implementation.  
- Collaborates with Marko on tech stack decisions and with Lukas for integrating AI components.  
- Often asks Jonas or Helene for feedback on how customers actually interpret UI elements.
