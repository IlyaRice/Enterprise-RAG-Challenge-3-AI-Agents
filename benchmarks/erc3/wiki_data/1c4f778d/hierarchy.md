# Company Hierarchy

Aetherion uses a **three-level hierarchy** that is intentionally lightweight. The goal is to maintain clarity without introducing bureaucracy.

- [People Overview](people/index.md)
- [Offices Overview](offices/index.md)

## Level 1 — Executive Leadership

### CEO — [Elena Vogel](people/elena_vogel.md)

Responsible for the overall direction of the company, key customer relationships, and the health of the business.  
Elena spends much of her time listening: to customers, to team members, to market signals.

### CTO — [Marko Petrovic](people/marko_petrovic.md)

Guardian of the technical direction and architecture.  
Marko keeps a mental map of every system the company has deployed and which patterns are worth repeating.

### COO — [Sofia Rinaldi](people/sofia_rinaldi.md)

Owner of operations, finances, and risk visibility.  
If something touches contracts, invoicing, or workload distribution, Sofia is involved.

## Level 2 — Team Leads / Senior Specialists

### Lead AI Engineer — [Lukas Brenner](people/lukas_brenner.md)

Lukas acts as the central reference point for AI engineering questions and complex PoCs that involve custom models or edge deployments.

### Lead Software Engineer — [Klara Houtman](people/klara_houtman.md)

Klara shapes the company’s approach to software architecture, application structure, and the maintainability of PoC codebases.

### Lead Consultant — [Jonas Weiss](people/jonas_weiss.md)

Jonas coordinates consulting engagements, workshops, and the broader customer success narrative.

## Level 3 — Core Team Members

Core team members operate with a high level of autonomy, working closely with one or more leads depending on the project.

- [Ana Kovác — Senior AI Engineer](people/ana_kovac.md)  
- [Felix Baum — AI Engineer](people/felix_baum.md)  
- [Mira Schäfer — Software Engineer](people/mira_schaefer.md)  
- [Timo van Dijk — Software Engineer](people/timo_van_dijk.md)  
- [Helene Stutz — Consultant / Analyst](people/helene_stutz.md)  
- [Richard Klein — Operations Coordinator](people/richard_klein.md)

## Reporting Lines (High-Level)

- Elena, Marko, and Sofia effectively report to the **board / investors** and to each other as a founding trio.  
- Leads report primarily to their respective executive sponsor (AI & Software → CTO, Consulting → COO).  
- Core team members report to the relevant lead, but interact frequently with executives.

The hierarchy is designed so that **no one is more than two steps away from a decision-maker**.
