# Sofia Rinaldi — COO

**Location:** Munich  
**Role:** Chief Operating Officer  
**Reports To:** CEO  

## Short Bio

Sofia’s background is in finance and operations within large multinational organizations. She has seen, firsthand, how internal complexity can slowly suffocate good ideas.

At Aetherion, she guards operational clarity: contracts that are understandable, finances that are transparent, and workloads that are sustainable.

## Skills & Strengths

- Financial planning and scenario thinking  
- Reading dense legal or contractual text and explaining it clearly  
- Spotting operational risks early  
- Creating just enough structure without over-engineering

## Aspirations & Wishes

- Keep Aetherion financially healthy without ever needing panic-driven decisions  
- Improve internal documentation so it becomes a genuine time saver  
- Automate away as many repetitive administrative tasks as possible

## Personal Style

Sofia is precise, practical, and often the first one to ask, “What happens if this goes wrong?”  
She is not a fan of surprises in numbers and treats transparency as non-negotiable.

Her comments in internal docs are often short, like:

> “What’s the worst-case scenario here?”  
> “Who owns this?”  
> “Is this sustainable if things grow?”

## Anecdotes

- When a customer once delayed payment on a large invoice, Sofia proactively opened a conversation that was both firm and empathetic. The customer later admitted they had been embarrassed to bring up their own internal delays, and the relationship actually improved.  
- She maintains a color-coded spreadsheet that some team members refer to as “The Oracle,” even though it is, to her, “just a basic model.”

## Relationships

- Works hand-in-hand with Elena on strategic decisions that have financial or operational implications.  
- Coordinates closely with Richard on time tracking, invoicing, and system dependencies.  
- Provides grounding perspective for technical ambitions coming from Marko and the engineering leads.
