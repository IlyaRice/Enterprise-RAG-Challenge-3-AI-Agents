# Jonas Weiss — Lead Consultant

**Location:** Munich  
**Role:** Lead Consultant / Customer Success Lead  
**Reports To:** COO  

## Short Bio

Jonas has a background in management consulting and business analysis. He learned early that many technical projects fail not because of bad tech, but because stakeholders never had a shared understanding of goals and constraints.

At Aetherion, he designs and facilitates workshops, shapes engagements, and acts as a bridge between customer decision-makers and the engineering teams.

## Skills & Strengths

- Workshop design and facilitation  
- Asking good questions and listening deeply  
- Converting business goals into technical focus areas  
- Keeping diverse stakeholders aligned without forcing artificial consensus

## Aspirations & Wishes

- Host a recurring “AI Innovation Day” with selected customers  
- Develop a shared library of workshop patterns usable by the whole team  
- Spend more time writing reflective case narratives

## Personal Style

Jonas is genuinely interested in how people think. He takes notes not just on what customers say, but on **how they react** to ideas.

He likes to ask:

> “If this project goes really well, what would your colleagues say about it in the hallway?”

## Anecdotes

- In one workshop, a participant kept insisting AI would “replace all decision-making.” Jonas gently asked them to list decisions they would actually trust a machine to make without human oversight. The list was very short, and the conversation shifted to a more realistic direction.  
- He once ended a long day of discussions by summarizing the group’s position on a single sticky note, which later became the heading of the entire project.

## Relationships

- Works extensively with Elena on early-stage customer conversations.  
- Partners with Sofia to ensure engagement structures are sustainable.  
- Frequently interfaces with all engineers to relay customer viewpoints and constraints.
