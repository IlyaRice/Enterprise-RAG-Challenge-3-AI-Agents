# Marko Petrovic — CTO

**Location:** Munich  
**Role:** Chief Technology Officer  
**Reports To:** CEO  

## Short Bio

Marko grew up fascinated by both mathematics and hardware. After a PhD in a field most people struggle to pronounce, he spent several years in a research lab working on advanced machine learning systems.

He co-founded Aetherion after realizing that many promising ideas never left research because no one took responsibility for making them **work in messy real environments**.

## Skills & Strengths

- Designing robust AI and data architectures  
- Deep understanding of modern ML frameworks and MLOps practices  
- Pattern recognition across projects — knowing what’s worth reusing  
- Turning vague technical concerns into clear trade-offs

## Aspirations & Wishes

- Build and maintain a small internal library of **reusable AI building blocks**  
- Ensure that no Aetherion project becomes a “mysterious black box”  
- Carve out regular time for pure technical exploration

## Personal Style

Marko’s communication style is dry and occasionally very funny in an understated way. He does not enjoy buzzwords and often translates them into plain language.

He is known for asking, in early meetings:

> “If this worked perfectly, what would actually change for the people using it?”

## Anecdotes

- During a customer visit, Marko once drew an architecture diagram on a whiteboard that looked like a subway map. An operator walked by, stared at it, and said, “Now I get it.” The diagram was later photographed and turned into an internal reference.  
- When a demo famously crashed due to his cat walking over the keyboard, Marko handled it so calmly that it became a company legend about staying grounded under stress.

## Relationships

- Works very closely with Lukas and Ana on the AI side and Klara, Mira, and Timo on the software side.  
- Has a running conversation with Sofia about balancing technical ambition with operational sanity.  
- Sometimes joins Jonas in customer workshops to ensure technical feasibility is considered early.
