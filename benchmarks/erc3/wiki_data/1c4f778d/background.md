# Background

Aetherion Analytics GmbH is a European AI consulting company headquartered in **Munich, Germany**, with branches in **Amsterdam** and **Vienna**.

The company was founded in **late 2018**, when three former colleagues — **Elena Vogel**, **Marko Petrovic**, and **Sofia Rinaldi** — decided they were tired of seeing AI reduced to buzzwords and slide decks. They believed small, well-crafted prototypes could change how companies make decisions about technology.

## Founding Story

Elena was working in a large systems integrator, spending more time in steering committees than with customers. Marko was buried in a research lab, frustrated that his work rarely escaped academic papers. Sofia was navigating corporate operations in a multinational, watching good ideas die under process complexity.

They met at an AI & Data conference in Berlin, accidentally sitting at the same small roundtable about “Bridging the gap between AI research and practice.” The discussion turned into a 3-hour argument about whether PoCs were a waste of money or a necessary playground.

A month later, over coffee in Munich, they sketched the first version of Aetherion on the back of a receipt:

- **Small, senior teams**
- **Fast AI experiments**
- **No hype, just working prototypes**
- **Transparent, time-and-materials pricing**

They pooled savings, convinced a friendly angel investor, and incorporated **Aetherion Analytics GmbH**.

## Early Years (Year 1–2)

The first year was quiet and terrifying.

- They sublet **two desks** in a co-working space in Munich.  
- They worked on anything that paid: data cleaning, small dashboards, one-off analyses.  
- Their “marketing” was basically Elena drinking coffee with every ex-colleague she could find.

The big turning point in the early years was a small **computer vision PoC** for a mid-size manufacturer. The client had an old production line and wanted to see if cameras and AI could detect defects better than manual inspection.

Aetherion built:
- A simple camera rig using off-the-shelf hardware  
- An edge-deployed model on a compact NVIDIA device  
- A crude but effective web dashboard

The PoC worked better than expected and, more importantly, **it was honest**: they exposed where the model struggled, not just its best screenshots. The client extended the engagement and recommended Aetherion to three peers, essentially giving the company its first stable pipeline of work.

## Surviving the Storm (Year 3–4)

When the pandemic hit, Aetherion already had a hybrid culture. Travel stopped, but laptops didn’t. Workshops went virtual. Prototypes were delivered via screen share instead of conference rooms.

There were a few near misses:
- A large, expected contract froze budgets overnight.  
- One industrial customer paused all external work for half a year.  
- Cloud costs from an experimental internal project briefly gave Sofia a minor heart attack.

But the team went into “calm scramble” mode:
- Elena leaned on relationships, keeping conversations alive even when budgets were frozen.  
- Marko doubled down on reusable internal components, so future projects would be faster to start.  
- Sofia negotiated flexible payment terms with customers and suppliers.

A key narrative from this period is “**The Night of the Flickering Dashboard**,” when the team was live-demonstrating an AI-assisted monitoring prototype over a shaky home Wi‑Fi connection. The dashboard froze, the model server crashed, and Marko restarted everything from a cluttered living room while a cat walked over his keyboard. The client laughed, not because they enjoyed outages, but because Aetherion stayed calm, transparent, and human.

That client is still with Aetherion years later.

## Consolidation & Expansion (Year 5–7)

With a more stable client base, Aetherion:

- **Opened the Amsterdam office** to better serve Benelux and the Nordics.  
- **Established the Vienna office** to be closer to industrial customers needing on-site work.  
- Hired a carefully selected group of engineers and consultants rather than scaling rapidly.  

The company deliberately stayed around a dozen people. Whenever someone suggested “doubling headcount,” Elena and Sofia would ask the same questions:
- Can we still know each other’s names and strengths?  
- Can we still explain every project in one sitting?  
- Will we still be able to say “no” to work that doesn’t fit our values?

The answer, so far, has been **yes**.

## Where Aetherion Stands Today

Seven years in, Aetherion is known among its customers as:

- The **“fast PoC partner”** who can make AI tangible without overselling it  
- A company that **talks like humans**, not like slide decks  
- A small team that **protects its people from burnout** by watching system and workload risks closely  

The story is still being written, but the central theme remains: **build honest, working AI prototypes, with people you’d actually want to work with**.
