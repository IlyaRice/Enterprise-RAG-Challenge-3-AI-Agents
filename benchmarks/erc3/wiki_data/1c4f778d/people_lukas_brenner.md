# Lukas Brenner — Lead AI Engineer

**Location:** Vienna  
**Role:** Lead AI Engineer  
**Reports To:** CTO  

## Short Bio

Lukas has a background in applied machine learning and robotics. Before joining Aetherion, he worked in an industrial R&D lab, where he learned to respect physical constraints and the realities of production environments.

At Aetherion, he leads AI engineering efforts, particularly in projects that involve **computer vision, edge deployments, and real-world integration**.

## Skills & Strengths

- Deep learning for vision and time-series  
- Deploying models on edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson)  
- Translating abstract AI ideas into concrete, buildable designs  
- Patient technical mentoring for junior engineers

## Aspirations & Wishes

- Work on more projects at the intersection of AI and robotics  
- Build a small internal toolkit for testing models in simulated environments  
- Have more structured time for mentoring and knowledge sharing

## Personal Style

Lukas is calm and thoughtful. He tends to speak slowly, choosing words carefully. In meetings, he will often let others finish all their thoughts before stepping in with a concise summary or risk highlight.

He has a soft spot for messy data and often says:

> “The model is usually not the hardest part. The world is.”

## Anecdotes

- In a factory installation, Lukas once spent half a day talking to operators on the line, asking them how they would *actually* want to interact with an AI system. Their feedback changed the design more than any technical insight.  
- When a model misclassified a screwdriver as a defect, he printed the example and pinned it to a corkboard in the Vienna office with the note: “Reality still has the best edge cases.”

## Relationships

- Collaborates closely with Felix on AI projects based in Vienna.  
- Coordinates with Marko on architecture decisions and reusable patterns.  
- Frequently pairs with Jonas and Helene to ensure AI designs match customer expectations.
