# Timo van Dijk — Software Engineer

**Location:** Amsterdam  
**Role:** Software Engineer  
**Reports To:** Lead Software Engineer  

## Short Bio

Timo is a backend-focused engineer who enjoys building systems that are **stable, observable, and understandable**. Before joining Aetherion, he helped maintain complex legacy systems and vowed to avoid recreating similar pain in new work.

At Aetherion, he takes care of backend services, data flows, and cloud deployments for PoCs and internal tools.

## Skills & Strengths

- Backend development and integration  
- Cloud deployments (especially in compact, cost-conscious setups)  
- Logging, metrics, and basic observability tools  
- Careful refactoring of early prototypes into more robust systems

## Aspirations & Wishes

- Move gradually into a hybrid AI/software role, working more closely with models  
- Build and maintain a reusable “AI PoC starter template” for projects  
- Experiment with infrastructure-as-code approaches tailored to small teams

## Personal Style

Timo is logical and persistent. He likes to understand how all parts of a system connect before making changes.

He often says:

> “Let’s make sure we know what we’re breaking before we break it.”

## Anecdotes

- During a late-stage test, Timo noticed a subtle performance issue that only appeared under specific conditions. He traced it down to an unbounded log statement, fixed it, and then wrote a short, clear explanation that became a mini-lesson in an internal channel.  
- He once drew a diagram of service dependencies that looked so elegant that someone suggested printing it as a poster.

## Relationships

- Works under Klara’s guidance on many Amsterdam-based projects.  
- Collaborates with Ana and Felix when backend services need to interact with AI components.  
- Syncs with Richard and Sofia when backend changes affect internal systems like time tracking or the dependency tracker.
